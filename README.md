# Branch Overview
* main - latest stable branch, any commits must work without errors before they can be merged back into main.
* develop - latest unstable branch, used for active development.
* neuralnet - fork from previous instance of develop, contains some features since removed (namely the Neural Network definition and SMOTE). This branch does not work and has an intentional exception thrown before reaching the neural network.
